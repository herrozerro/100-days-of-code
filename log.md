# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Personal Project, Writing Git.  Starting over on old xamerin project.  Going with dotnet core and WPF for now to get an actual working POC

**Thoughts:** Going simpler now.  Last time I just crashed into trying to get a git implimentation for android working.  I'm going simple, trying to get an actual POC going.  Making sure I separate out my projects so i can have a core implimentation that hopefully can get ported.
