# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Personal Project, Writing Git.  Starting over on old xamerin project.  Going with dotnet core and WPF for now to get an actual working POC

**Thoughts:** Going simpler now.  Last time I just crashed into trying to get a git implimentation for android working.  I'm going simple, trying to get an actual POC going.  Making sure I separate out my projects so i can have a core implimentation that hopefully can get ported.

### Day 2: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent all of my time messing with [wasm-git](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git) and blazor to see if this is feasible.  Not sure if I made any progress.

**Thoughts:** Trying not to get discouraged by finding yet another possible dead end.

### Day 3: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working with a git-wasm library.  trying to figure out if I can use this with blazor.  If not, maybe I need to switch stacks and go node.

**Thoughts:** I had fun playing with a project and tinkering with it to see how it worked
